I am a Ph.D. student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in the Wireless Innovation Laboratory (WILab) advised by Prof. Alexander Wyglinski. My reserach involves building forecasting models for predicting traffic demands in communication networks and using predicted traffic demands to inform routing decisions. My expected graudation date is May 2026. 

Prior to joining WPI, I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Lousiana State Univeristy (LSU) in 2020 and 2022, respectively. At LSU 

In my spare time I enjoy training for half marathons and rock climbing (both indoors and outside).
