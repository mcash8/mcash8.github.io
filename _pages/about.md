I am a Ph.D. student in the Wireless Innovation Laboratory (WILab) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I am advised by Prof. Alexander Wyglinski. My research focuses on developing forecasting models to predict traffic demands in communication networks and leveraging these predictions to improve routing decisions. I expect to graduate in May 2026.

Before joining WPI, I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Louisiana State University (LSU) in 2020 and 2022, respectively. My master's degree thesis focused on using neural networks for receiver error correction in a satellite communication system. My thesis can be downloaded [here](https://repository.lsu.edu/gradschool_theses/5615/).

Outside of research, I enjoy training for half marathons and rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors.
