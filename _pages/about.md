I am a Ph.D. student in the Wireless Innovation Laboratory (WILab) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I am advised by Prof. Alexander Wyglinski. My research focuses on developing forecasting models to predict traffic demands in communication networks and leveraging these predictions to improve routing decisions. I expect to graduate in May 2026.

Before joining WPI, I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Louisiana State University (LSU) in 2020 and 2022, respectively.

Outside of research, I enjoy training for half marathons and rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors.
